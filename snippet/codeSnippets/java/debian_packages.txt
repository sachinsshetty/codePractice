Create an empty text file called, e.g. packagedeb.sh in the root of your project, just inside the src directory.
If you do this from within Eclipse, the script is automatically copied to the bin directory. 
Add the following lines to the file:

#!/bin/sh

PACKAGE_NAME="programname"
PACKAGE_VERSION="0.3"
SOURCE_DIR=$PWD
TEMP_DIR="/tmp"

mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR/debian/DEBIAN
mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib
mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR/debian/bin
mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR/debian/usr/share/applications
mkdir -p $TEMP_DIR/debian/usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE_NAME

This next part of the script builds the directory hierarchy for the .deb file. Basically, we create a directory called debian (lower-case) in the temporary dir, and here we put files and directories that we would like to put on the user's system. So, if we want to install a file in /usr/share/applications, we create /tmp/debian/usr/share/applications and put a copy of the file there. In this part of the script, still only empty directories, though. We also create a directory called DEBIAN (upper-case) for meta data for the .deb package.

echo "Package: $PACKAGE_NAME" > $TEMP_DIR/debian/DEBIAN/control
echo "Version: $PACKAGE_VERSION" >> $TEMP_DIR/debian/DEBIAN/control
cat debian/control >> $TEMP_DIR/debian/DEBIAN/control


cp debian/programname.desktop $TEMP_DIR/debian/usr/share/applications/
cp debian/copyright $TEMP_DIR/debian/usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE_NAME/


cp -r ../bin/ $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME

gzip -9c $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME/NEWS > $TEMP_DIR/debian/usr/share/doc/$PACKAGE_NAME/change_log.gz


After that, I set permissions to 644 for the file, which is what the Debian system expects for icons.

rm -r $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME/debian
rm $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME/COPYING
rm $TEMP_DIR/debian/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME/packagedeb.sh


echo '#!/bin/sh' > $TEMP_DIR/debian/bin/programname
echo "export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/lib/$PACKAGE_NAME" >> $TEMP_DIR/debian/bin/programname
echo "java main/MyMainClass $1" >> $TEMP_DIR/debian/bin/programname
chmod 755 $TEMP_DIR/debian/bin/programname


PACKAGE_SIZE=`du -bs $TEMP_DIR/debian | cut -f 1`
PACKAGE_SIZE=$((PACKAGE_SIZE/1024))
echo "Installed-Size: $PACKAGE_SIZE" >> $TEMP_DIR/debian/DEBIAN/control

## need to check if root is enable,  all users can acess it
chown -R root $TEMP_DIR/debian/
chgrp -R root $TEMP_DIR/debian/

cd $TEMP_DIR/
dpkg --build debian
mv debian.deb $SOURCE_DIR/$PACKAGE_NAME-$PACKAGE_VERSION.deb
rm -r $TEMP_DIR/debian
