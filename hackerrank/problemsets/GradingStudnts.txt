HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

    Every student receives a in the inclusive range from to .
    Any less than is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's according to these rules:

    If the difference between the and the next multiple of is less than , round up to the next multiple of .
    If the value of is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

For example, will be rounded to but will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than .

Given the initial value of for each of Sam's students, write code to automate the rounding process.

    Student received a , and the next multiple of from is . Since , the student's grade is rounded to .
    Student received a , and the next multiple of from is . Since , the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
    Student received a , and the next multiple of from is . Since , the student's grade will be rounded to .
    Student received a grade below , so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
